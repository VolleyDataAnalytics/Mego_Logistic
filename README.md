# Mego Logistics: Comprehensive Optimization of Nationwide Delivery Routes Across India 🚚📦

## Introduction
Mego Logistics 🚚📦, a pioneer in the logistics and supply chain industry, specializes in delivering high-quality clothing shipments 👕📦 to every corner of India 🇮🇳. With a reputation for excellence and reliability ⭐, the company operates out of its central warehouse located at the Mumbai Dock ⚓, Maharashtra 🏢. This warehouse serves as the main hub from which shipments are dispatched to 28 state capitals 🏠 and 8 Union Territories ⭐, ensuring comprehensive nationwide coverage.

This project focuses on optimizing the delivery route for a single vehicle 🚛. The truck will start its journey from Mumbai Dock ⚓, travel across India, deliver shipments tailored to the specific needs of each destination, and finally return to Mumbai Dock. The key to this operation is designing a route that ensures minimal travel distance while maintaining efficient delivery schedules.

Each destination will receive clothing items 📦 specific to its climate, culture, and customer preferences, ensuring that Mego Logistics meets the unique needs of every region it serves.
